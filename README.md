#MyDiary 

## Summary

I veray like Makoto Shinkai's (新海 誠) movies!  This project is just try to create  the app - "My Diary" in "your name." on Android. In this movie , "My Diary" is a important app between Taki(瀧) and Mitsuha(三葉) . As a fan, I think maybe I can implement this app. If you also like "your name.", please join me to finish the "My Diary" , let it be true.

This project will need :
* Android developer
* GUI designer
* Japanese/English translation 

## Why is only Android verison?

In fact , Android version is more difficult than iOS ,becaus this app is run on iOS in the movie. But I will only create Android version becasue:

1. I don't have any mac now :P 
2. Android's apk is easy to release.

so , maybe I will try to create iOS version after this app is running.

## Usecase

Because DVD/BD doesn't be released  now, so the use case is from my memory and network information. 
If you have any idea or find some function what I lose  , you can tell me or update the use case in **/UML/MyDiary.mdj**  by [starUML](http://staruml.io/):
